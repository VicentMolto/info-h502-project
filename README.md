# INFO-H502 OpenGL Project

Project made in OpenGL for the course INFO-H502 Virtual Reality, at ULB.

It depicts the four inner planets of the solar system.

Implemented elements:  
  - Diffuse light.  
  - Specular light.  
  - Animation and movement.  
  - Instancing.  
  - Geometry shader for drawing the normals.  
  - Geometry shader for "exploding" objects.  
  - Model importing using Assimp library.  
  - Texturing.  
  - Transparent shading.  
  - Translucid shading.  
  - Reflective shading.  
  - Refractive shading.  
  - Mouse and keyboard control.  
  - Skybox.  
  
To run it, simply download it and build it with CMake.
It runs properly on Windows and Linux. We were not able to run it on Mac because it seems Apple's compiler does not work properly with the Assimp importing library.
